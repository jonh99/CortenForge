# Introduction

This book is for contributors to the Pipelinea substrate. It covers the architecture, core crates, hooks/extension points, app patterns, tools, testing, and migration/roadmap.

Build this book:
```bash
mdbook build docs/contributor_book
```

See `MIGRATION.md` at the repo root for a summary of the recent refactor (root orchestrator, app crates under `apps/`, tools move, recorder defaults, tests/docs refresh).
